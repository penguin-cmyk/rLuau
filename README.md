# rLuau
- rLuau is a project (for fun) of mine which is used to convert rust code into luau (specfically rLuau (roblox luau) code)
- It is ment for people who just wanna use a new way of writing the code
# How to run this Project?
- Download [Lune](https://github.com/lune-org/lune) which is a luau runtime written in rust
- Download (or clone `https://github.com/penguin-cmyk/rLuau.git`) the project

- Set Lune as a enviorenment variable ([Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2k7ZBMZT3Y)) or drag the Lune file into the folder
- Do `lune run main.luau` and done!

# Notes
- Now you can modify the code you want in main.luau where it will be handled
- I recommend you to use something like vscode without any rust-analyzer used and create a new rs file (easier to do it with syntax highlighting)

- ** THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS **

# Planned
- Planned stuff thats going to be added
  - [] Vectors
  - [] If statements
  - [] Hashmaps
